It was supposed to be free and open-source with a good-looking and convenient UI and to include frequently used features for database developers. The first official release was in 2011 on Freecode. It quickly became a popular tool in the open-source community. In the same year, the official web site was founded and the community support forum (now moved to GitHub) was created. In 2012 an Eclipse plugin version was released - since then DBeaver has become one of the most popular database extensions for Eclipse (top 50-60 among all Eclipse extensions). Shortly after, various software vendors started to integrate with DBeaver (mostly as an extensions to their proprietary Eclipse RCP products: Zend Studio, NXTware, DeltaDNA, etc.). In 2014 the Enterprise Edition (EE) version was released. The EE version is based on CE but also provides support of NoSQL/BigData databases (Cassandra, MongoDB and Redis) and includes a few additional Eclipse plugins. In 2015 DBeaver source code/community has moved to GitHub. In 2017 DBeaver CE was relicensed under Apache License (starting from version 4.x). In July 2017 DBeaver EE version became commercial in order to support CE version."

                "text": "Valencia was born in Santa Marta, Colombia. He left Colombia at the age of 15 to go and play in the River Plate youth academy. He was formed for Club Deportivo Independiente San Joaquin. His coach was Jose Luis Cruz (Tucumano) He initially played as an Attacking Midfielder, but at the age of 17 when he joined the River 1st team he was used as a left-back, and to take corners and throw ins. He made his debut on 10 November 2007 in River's 2-1 loss to Huracan and played the full 90 minutes in his debut. After starting two games at the end of the season for River Plate, several French clubs became interested and he eventually joined Dijon FCO. In 2009, he returned to Argentina to play for Estudiantes de La Plata. On 17 May 2009 he came on as a substitute against Independiente in the 77th minute and then scored his first goal for the club to finish off a 5-1 win. On 11 August 2009, Valencia was signed by Godoy Cruz and on 22 December 2009 his club released the Colombian left-back. In the summer of 2010 he signed to the Portuguese Liga club Portimonense, but he was loaned to Sportivo Luqueno."

The site's critical consensus reads, \"Shoddily crafted and devoid of suspense, \"Cell\" squanders a capable cast and Stephen King's once-prescient source material on a bland rehash of zombie cliches.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 38 out of 100, based on 15 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\". Bob Grimm of CV Independent wrote that the movie \"is easily one of the worst adaptations ever of a King story.\" Arts BHAM's Corey Craft called the film \"dull\", \"a trial to get through\" and gave it 1 stars out of 5. Nico Lang of \"Consequence of Sound\" wrote that \"Cell\" wasted an intriguing premise and called the film \"unnecessarily glum and grim,\" as well as \"pretty dumb.\" Patrick Cooper of Bloody Disgusting called it a \"forgettable adaptation\" and further stated that \"the story packs absolutely no punch and the solid stable of actors look bored for most of the film.\""

In 1925 they were allocated Great Southern Railways (GSR) Class 646 / Inchicore Class J2. The MGWR Class B was an attempt at a more powerful 0-6-0 locomotive than the existing Class L. Like the Class A 4-4-0 which they shared some components they were weight restricted to the Dublin-Galway on the MGWR. They were rebuilt 1916/17 with superheating. On scrapping some of their tenders were givin to Class A locomotives."

According to the Tacoma Public Library's Washington Place Names database: \"In 1900, it was chosen as a station by the Spokane-Coeur d'Alene Electric Railway, and was named Woodard's for the family who owned the land along the railway route. When Inland Empire Paper Company built a paper mill they requested a name change to Milltown. Railway officials refused the change unless the Woodard family agreed. A compromise resulted, using the word mill combined with the first four letters of Woodard. It was incorporated October 27, 1927.\" The Rosebush House, located in the center of Millwood, \"is one of Millwood's best preserved homes\" and is listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places."

His clubs included Distillery, Belfast Celtic, Luton Town and Gillingham. He later became reserve team manager at Gillingham, and in 1965 was appointed by manager Freddie Cox as the head of the club's newly organised youth scheme, a post he held for nearly twenty years. He served as first team trainer and kitman for a further ten years, finally retiring in 1993 at the age of 73. He has been cited as a major influence on the careers of future stars Micky Adams and Steve Bruce. He died in 2010 at the age of 90."

Alegria, was a former Vice President and founding member of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party. It was Alegria's father who instilled him with a sense of love and pride for Puerto Rico, its history, and culture. In 1941 at the University of Puerto Rico, together with Yamil Galib, Alegria founded a new fraternity, Alpha Beta Chi. In 1942, Alegria earned his Bachelor of Science degree in archeology from the University of Puerto Rico. He continued his academic education in the University of Chicago where in 1947 he earned his master's in Anthropology and History. In 1954, Alegria earned his Ph.D (doctorate) in Anthropology from Harvard University."

Their synagogue was set on fire and destroyed as part of Kristallnacht (9 November 1938). Witness thereto is a memorial plaque at the Evangelical church. Also bearing witness to the former Jewish community is the Jewish graveyard lying roughly 400 m south of the village."

The D300S remained the premier Nikon DX camera until the D7100 was released in early 2013."

It offers both high resolution and high speed (being able to capture 6 frames per second, and 8 frames per second with the addition of an optional MB-D10 battery pack). The D300 has not only a built-in autofocus motor for all Nikon autofocus-lenses, but includes CPU and metering for older Nikon F-mount AI/AI-S lenses and the new generation perspective control lenses (PC-E). The built-in intervalometer (timer) can be used for time-lapse low-light movies."

Good communication with St. John's was established by road in the 1830s and strengthened in the 1880s with the arrival of the railway. Residents of Conception Bay South grew crops and raised cattle for the St. John's market and St. John's residents established summer homes in Conception Bay South."

The Admirals' Coast scenic route follows Route 60 along the western and southern shore of Conception Bay between Marysvale to Paradise, and provides excellent views over the bay. Conception Bay South is the largest community in the Admirals' Coast and provides many amenities for tourists visiting the region. The town is one of the few to have a geological attraction, namely the trilobite fossil beds along the Manuels River Linear Park. The fossils found here are similar to those found in southern Spain and Portugal and northern Africa, but different from those found in western Newfoundland. This was a key in establishing the theory of plate tectonics, or continental drift. The town also has a marina at Foxtrap, site of a famous 19th century \"battle.\" The town is home to the Royal Newfoundland Yacht Club at Long Pond, which received permission for use of the Prefix Royal, and the Blue Ensign. A popular seaside attraction is Topsail Beach, in the east end of town."

Its plot follows the younger half-sister of Carrie White, also suffering with telekineses, who finds that her best friend's suicide was spurned by a group of popular male classmates who exploited her for sexual gain. The film is a sequel to the 1976 horror film \"Carrie\", based on the novel of the same name by Stephen King and the second film in the \"Carrie\" film franchise. Irving reprises her role as Sue Snell. The film was released on March 12, 1999, and received generally negative reviews from critics. The film was a box office bomb at the time of release, grossing $17 million against a $21 million production budget."

The film eventually went into production in 1998 under the title \"Carrie 2: Say You're Sorry\". A few weeks into production, director Robert Mandel quit over creative differences and Katt Shea hurriedly took over the reins with less than a week to prepare to start filming, and two weeks' worth of footage to reshoot."

Rotten Tomatoes reported the film had a 20% approval rating based on 35 reviews with the consensus: \"As disposable as its predecessor is indispensable, \"The Rage: Carrie 2\" mimics the arc of Stephen King's classic story without adding anything of value.\" On Metacritic it had a rating of 42 on a scale from 0-100 based on 21 reviews indicating mixed or average reviews. Roger Ebert gave the film 2 out of 4 stars stating \"The original \"Carrie\" worked because it was a skillful teenage drama grafted onto a horror ending. Also, of course, because De Palma and his star, Sissy Spacek, made the story convincing. \"The Rage: Carrie 2\" is more like a shadow\". Anita Gates of \"The New York Times\" characterized it as \"typical B-movie making. The actors are attractive and do credible jobs, and in the tradition of the original film, there's one really good scare at the end.\" Dennis Harvey of \"Variety\" panned the film, noting that it \"uses the original as a blueprint, but leaves out all the wit, sympathy and bravado.\" Ty Burr of \"Entertainment Weekly\" gave the film a more favorable B-minus rating, praising Bergl's performance and summarizing that the film is \"better than it deserves to be.\" Kevin Thomas of the \"Los Angeles Times\" championed the film as a \"well-directed sequel\" that \"accepts the telekinetic gimmick as an obligatory plot device [to] rage against high school machismo.\""

He was the younger brother of Brig. Gen. Peter Gansevoort (1749-1812). Gansevoort's ancestors had been in Albany since 1660, when it was the Dutch colony of Fort Orange, and Harmen Harmense Gansevoort (ca. 1634-1709) owned a brewery and farms. His brother's son, Peter Gansevoort, Herman Gansevoort (1779-1862) built the Gansevoort Mansion in 1813 on his father's tract at Gansevoort in Saratoga County, New York. His father was the third of his family's generation in America, who were prominent brewers and merchants in Albany. His mother was descended from the Van Rensselaer family as her mother, Anna Van Rensselaer, was a daughter of Hendrick van Rensselaer (1667-1740), who had married Peter Douw. In addition, his first cousin, Leonard Gansevoort (1754-1834), an Albany lawyer and alderman, was married to Maria Van Rensselaer (1760-1841), the daughter of Col. Kiliaen van Rensselaer (1717-1781), the granddaughter of Hendrick van Rensselaer and the sister of Henry K. Van Rensselaer (1744-1816), Philip Kiliaen van Rensselaer (1747-1798), and Killian K.

At that time, Soldier Field had only about 76,000 seats, but managed to hold a record-breaking crowd, estimated at nearly 120,000, that turned out to watch DeCorrevont face off against Leo's star, Johnny Galvin. In the game, DeCorrevont ran three touchdowns, one for 47 yards, and passed for a fourth, leading Austin to a resounding victory, 26-0. The game garnered so much publicity for DeCorrevont that his broken collarbone (injured that December) gained mention in both the \"Chicago Tribune\" and \"The New York Times\"."

He chose Northwestern University for both its proximity to Chicago and its strong academic reputation, a choice which was possibly also aided by his familial connections to Wildcat football. One older cousin, George Wilson, had played as an end in the mid-1930s, and another, Jack Riley, had been an acclaimed football captain and All-American tackle at Northwestern in the 1930s as well. Enrolling at Northwestern alongside him were four former teammates from Austin: Alf Bauman, Sonny Skor, Chuck Feingarten, and Donald Johnson. DeCorrevont matriculated at Northwestern in 1938 and started playing on Northwestern's football and baseball teams his freshman year. He joined the Sigma Chi fraternity, as did his brother Howard \"Bud\" DeCorrevont (1917-1997) who attended Northwestern at the same time. Otto Graham, another famous Northwestern football player, joined the team in 1940 when DeCorrevont was a sophomore."

Number 1 Petofi Sandor Utca was formerly the mansion of Jeno Rakosi, and an established meeting point for poets and writers for many years. The wooden Szekely Gate next door was given to Balatonfoldvar by one of its twin towns Zetelaka in 1995. Number 9 Petofi Sandor Utca is 'Kulpintyo', the former residence of Zsigmond Szechenyi, a famous writer and hunter who was also a member of the famous Szechenyi family. Number 11 Petofi Sandor Utca was the residence of Gizi Bajor, a notable actress and member of the National Theatre. An avenue in the town and the community centre (1994) were named after her. Number 13 Petofi Sandor Utca (1896) is one of the most notable buildings in town, given that it belonged to Professor Friges Koranyi, doctor to the Szechenyi family, whose idea it was to develop the area of Balatonfoldvar as a bathing resort. This building is built in a Neo-Roman style."

None of the genes affected in individuals with 22q11.2DS have previously been linked to PD but there are a number that are likely candidates. These include DGCR8 which is important for biogenesis of brain microDNA, SRPT5 which encodes a protein that interacts with the PARK2 protein, COMT which is involved in regulating dopamine levels, and microRNA miR-185 which is thought to target known PD loci LRRK2."

He didn't appear competitively for the club, though was an unused substitute once during the 2012-13 Argentine Primera Division season against Union Santa Fe on 25 August 2012. In June 2013, Baima was loaned to Primera B Nacional's Aldosivi. He made his professional debut during a 3-0 defeat to San Martin on 4 August, prior to netting his first goal against Defensa y Justicia on 24 August. Baima left Boca Juniors permanently in January 2015, joining Defensores de Belgrano in Primera B Metropolitana. Seventy-nine games and five goals followed in three seasons. On 14 February 2018, Baima completed a move to Croatian Second Football League side Dugopolje. His first appearance for the club arrived on 10 March versus Sibenik, while his final match came in a defeat to Lucko as Dugopolje finished sixth in 2017-18. Baima returned to Argentine football in July 2018 after he signed for Chacarita Juniors in Primera B Nacional."

After leaving secondary education, she returned to London to attend Central St Martins, gaining a Foundation Diploma in Art. Following her graduation, Muller went to the Royal College of Art to study for her Masters in Film and Television, where she made \"Interlude\" and \"In Excelsis Deo\" (In Adoration of God). The latter won the J. Walter Thompson Prize for creativity. Her trademark style in most of her videos usually has a singer or a band inside a dim, isolated room."
